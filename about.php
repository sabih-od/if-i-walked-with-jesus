                    <p  class="slideTwo">Welcome to my page <q>If I had walked with Jesus</q></p>
                    <p class="para" data-aos="fade-right">First off, let me assure you that I am NO expert in the Religious field of study. I
                        am an ordinary individual just like you, who is taking this opportunity to share bible study
                        time with you. I like to go slow and imagine myself in that time and wonder what else was going
                        on around what we read. I ask OODLES of questions and most of them won’t be answered here on
                        earth.</p>

                    <p class="para" data-aos="fade-right">Over the years I have had many ups and downs in my walk with Jesus, but I have never
                        wandered so far away that I couldn’t hear him in the background calling to me. My heart grieves
                        for those who have, but that is not my story. During my walk, especially in the down times, I
                        have come to rely on journaling. It started with simply putting down my thoughts, pain in
                        particular, and letting them lead me where they would. That process brought me a little peace
                        but not nearly as much as I craved. When I finally invited my bible, and my Lord, into my
                        journal time I began receiving more of the peace I was so desperately seeking. Is everything
                        peaceful and perfect for me now? Not hardly!!</p>

                    <p class="para" data-aos="fade-right">I tried approaching the scriptures through the typical bible study methods (i.e.
                        topical studies, in depth analysis) but always felt lost or unqualified. It wasn’t until I
                        simply read a short passage and wrote about what I had read, while placing myself in that
                        picture, that I felt connected to God’s word. I would imagine what the people around the
                        character were doing, or come up with a question I knew someone must have been thinking at the
                        time. Often these questions lead me to inspiration or insight into my own life. Frequently I
                        felt like my pen/pencil took on a life of its own as the answers or insight flowed out of it.
                        These times I attribute directly to God and have come to recognize Him speaking into my life by
                        me being open and willing with pen and paper ready.</p>

                        I have learned so much in this open process. I want to share some of it with you. I want to do
                        this in a couple of ways. First, I want to invite you to walk with me as I slowly look at the
                        scriptures again. I’ve gone through the bible reading and writing before and thought about just
                        posting my past journal writings but felt it would be so much more profitable for us all to
                        simply start again, in Matthew, and go through it this time with you. Secondly, I have compiled
                        several of my previous poems and reflections into a book that I self-published for my family one
                        Christmas. If this site allows, I want to make it available for you to view too. If you feel
                        inspired or touched by something you read, feel free to print that page and/or repost it. All I
                        ask is that you give me and God credit for it, as we together authored it. I will probably add
                        more poetry or stories to this group at some time in our journey.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">I am ALWAYS open to your views, questions, and/or opinions on what I post and
                        welcome comments. I trust this will be a journey unlike any before. I also trust that God will
                        guide our steps as we walk in Jesus footsteps.</p>

                    <p class="para">My mom sent me an email recently and told me that I don’t even have my name on my
                        own page. She also wanted me to share some of my personal story too. When I started this blog, I
                        was mainly concerned about stating what I was hoping to accomplish, and why I was going about it
                        the way I was. I guess now is as good a time as any to peek behind the curtain and meet me.</p>
                    <p class="para">This is hard for me to do because I don’t know what parts to share, so I’m going to
                        go with some of the highlights from beginning to now. Feel free to skip any part you think too
                        boring.</p>
                    <p class="para">I am the second oldest child in a family with five children. We are my older sister
                        (Karen), me (Annette), my brother (Tim), my second brother (Daniel), and my baby sister (April).
                        Our home was seldom quiet with all of us running around getting into mischief. One of our
                        favorite phrases, when my parents would leave us at home for some reason, was “Nobody tell on
                        nobody and nobody gets in trouble.” My poor parents probably still don’t know half the things we
                        got into, and I’m still not telling! The celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 2011 so we
                        at least didn’t destroy them in the process.</p>

                <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">I got my first pair of glasses when I was 13 months old. I had such severe vision
                        problems that it interfered with my gross motor development. It is a good thing I was born a
                        stubborn child and muscled my way through anyway. I never have been good at taking “no” or
                        “you’ll never be able to do that” for an answer. Just ask my mom about the MANY lessons I had to
                        learn the hard way because of that attitude. But I was also a child who loved to “help”, so my
                        mom got smart and asked for “favors” or “help” to get me to cooperate.</p>
                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">I was first introduced to writing when I was a Sophomore in High School. We had to
                        keep a journal for my English class. I discovered that I loved to write, especially poetry. I
                        didn’t pick up serious journaling after the assignment was finished, but did begin writing
                        poetry whenever my feelings overwhelmed me to the point that I just HAD to get them out. I wish
                        I still had all the poems I wrote over the years. Check out my book (and blog page) Lessons
                        Learned on Daddy’s Lap if you haven’t already. I returned to journaling while in college the
                        first time because of a Creative Writing class.</p>
                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">Yes, I said “college the first time.” I actually have completed three college
                        degrees and one vocational training program over the years. I initially returned to college to
                        support myself and my children. After 10 years in the military (he did the service and I was the
                        spouse) and 11 years married, my husband decided he didn’t want to be married any more. “I don’t
                        love you like I used to. Nothing you can do about it. I want a divorce.” We had four beautiful
                        children over the life of our marriage; my oldest son Don, my daughter Sasha (who changed her
                        name to Kelyana), my middle son David, and my youngest son Joseph. At this time my children were
                        9, 7, 5 1/2 and 2 1/2. I needed a better income to support “my four and no more” than my
                        vocational training in Child Development could provide. I also didn’t believe I could count on
                        child support and REFUSED to live forever on government programs. Don’t get me wrong, I truly
                        believe in using whatever is available when you need it, but government programs are supposed to
                        be used as a hand up, not a hand out</p>
                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">After graduating college the first time with my Associates degree in Occupational
                        Therapy, my children and I moved from Oregon to Tennessee. I drove the Ryder truck with my van
                        on a car trailer behind it, while my children read the maps and street signs. It took us four
                        and a half days to complete our trip to our “new future.” We remained in the Eastern part of the
                        United States for three years; living in Tennessee and Virginia and driving to Kentucky for
                        church and shopping. Those were lonely years without our extended family, but we did make some
                        very good friends there. My oldest son even got his driver’s license while we lived there. I
                        also redeveloped my eating disorder, that started in High School, which landed me in the
                        hospital for a month and eventually lead to me losing my job. My mom came out while I was in the
                        hospital to stay with my children and, once I lost my job, my dad flew out and we all “wagon
                        trained” back to Oregon.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">This was a very dark time for me and only through faith in God, journaling, and MUCH
                        support (including counseling and medication) did I survive it. I fought suicidal urges on a
                        near daily basis for several years. VERY FEW people know how bad it got inside, but my post
                        “From the Caterpillar to the Butterfly” is a thank You letter to God for carrying me through it.
                        During this time I also went back to college because the field I trained in initially was
                        shrinking and I was unable to find employment. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer
                        Systems with a minor in Business Management and STILL couldn’t find a job. Things were REALLY
                        dark for me after that. I was finally hired at Wal-Mart and by a local naturopathic clinic. One
                        shining moment in that dark place was the birth of my first grandson, Damion. He is my oldest
                        son Don’s oldest son.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">While working at the naturopathic clinic I met my wonderful husband, Steve. I had
                        been single and faithful to my children alone for twelve years. I only had two dates during
                        those years. I refused to subject my children to a string of boyfriends and step parent
                        relationships that might not work out. They, and I, had been badly hurt once and I wasn’t taking
                        the chance on it happening again. My oldest two children had left home by now and my youngest
                        two were constantly engaged in doing things with their friends. I was beginning to feel the
                        emptiness. I was still in the dark place, though it had lightened some. I was also still fully
                        engulfed in my eating disorder. We met in January and were married in November of the same year.
                        We have now been married for 10 years and plan on a lifetime more! Marrying him also increased
                        my count of children. Steve’s daughter Stevena, and his son Jon merged with my bunch. We are now
                        “my four and two more.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">I left both jobs that I had found after graduating for a position with Miracle Ear.
                        I served many wonderful people through that office for five years. One of the scholarships I
                        received during my last time in college offered me the opportunity to continue on in school if I
                        wanted to. At this point in my life I was finally in a good place emotionally and wanted to help
                        others like they had helped me during the dark years. I went back to school and earned my
                        Master’s degree in Applied Psychology. I had great plans for after graduation but, again, things
                        didn’t go exactly as I thought they would. My husband had, at a much earlier time in his life,
                        suffered from a brain tumor. The resultant treatment, including five brain operations and
                        radiation therapy, left him with serious disabilities. I knew of his history when we married and
                        they did not frighten me away. Over the years though, his issues have grown to the point where,
                        by the time I graduated, he was not safe to remain home alone. I willingly chose to become his
                        caregiver, and was mercifully able to do so through a program that pays me to provide his care.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">Through the years we have also added many members to our ever growing family. We
                        welcomed our eighth grandchild in 2015 and my middle son and his wife are actively trying to
                        bless us with a ninth. We have (in birth order) Damion and Jared (Don’s sons), Akuma and Aurora
                        (Kelyana’s son and daughter), Eve (Jon’s daughter), Cailyn (Joseph’s daughter), Eli (Jon’s son),
                        and Angeline (Stevena’s daughter). Ages for these gracious gifts from God (as of May 18, 2016,
                        which is Cailyn’s birthday) are 12, almost 11, 10, 9, 4 1/2, 4, 3, and 1. Eve will be 5 in
                        September and Jared 11 in July. All but Eve and Eli live within 25 miles of us and we see them
                        often. Eve and Eli live about a four hour drive away. We don’t get to see them as often as we
                        would like to, but Facebook lets us peek in on their lives a lot more often.

                    <p class="para"  data-aos="fade-right">I guess I will end with my hobbies and interests. I LOVE music! I sing every chance
                        I get. I just sang for the first time at a funeral last week for my husband’s step mother. I
                        have always loved children and have ministered to them through many different avenues, but
                        especially enjoy just playing with them on their level. Cailyn and I had a princess/animal party
                        today. I enjoy sewing and just discovered quilting last year. I completed over 25 quilts in
                        2015. I have a few more to go before all my children and grandchildren have their own special
                        one (or two) made. I love reading. My favorite genres are mystery, Christian fiction, drama, and
                        most any children’s book. I LOVE reading to my grandchildren and making the characters come
                        alive with different voices for each. My two favorite children’s books are Love you forever by
                        Robert Munsch and The Monster at the End of the Book by Jon Stone.</p>
