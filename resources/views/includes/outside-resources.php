                                I gave one to Steveâ€™s mom and Steve as gifts. She uses hers all the time. I canâ€™t get it
                                in large print because it would be bigger than a Strongâ€™s Concordance. It also wonâ€™t fit
                                my Kindle because of the charts and graphics. I have to use my SUPER magnifying glasses
                                to read it. People with normal eyesight donâ€™t have this problem though.</p>

                                illustrated and easy to understand. The only drawback to this bible story book is that
                                it doesnâ€™t link chapter and verse of where to find the story in your regular bible.</p>
