                            <p class="para">The one who doesn’t know when to shut up can make a MAJOR mess of things. The loud mouth seldom has anything edifying to say. His aim is to stir things up. Before we dig in, I have to make a distinction. There are people who like to visit with one another. They can talk […]</p>
